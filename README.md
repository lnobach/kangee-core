Kangee is an easy-to-use personal on-demand fileserver, enabling you to exchange files with your friends. 
Your communication partner only needs a browser to download or upload files to you. 
Unlike one-click hosting services, Kangee will not store files on any remote machine, instead, 
users become their own one-click hoster. Kangee is developed for the Java Runtime Environment, 
therefore supporting many operating systems.

For Kangee, a type of Internet access is needed that supports incoming connections, 
like many ADSL/Cable providers do. However, often mobile 3G internet access providers 
do not support this feature yet.

Since Kangee is targeted to be very user-friendly, it will also help you with the connection setup.

**Comments in the code are envisioned to be improved.**
